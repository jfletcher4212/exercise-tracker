# Exercise Tracker REST API

### A microservice that stores and retrieves exercise data for the user

#### Fulfills the following user stories:

##### 1. I can create a new user ID.
##### 2. I can store an exercise log tied to a user ID, consisting of a description, duration (mins), and date (yyyy-mm-dd)
##### 3. I can load a list of exercise logs associated with a user ID, and, optionally, further filter by date (from a date and to a date), and limit the results to a certain number. Data is returned as a JSON object
##### 4. All user data is validated, but will not necessarily return an error message. In particular, invalid to/from dates (see 3.) will not explicitly fail, but quietly continue without those fields.
